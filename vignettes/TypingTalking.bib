  abstract = {This study synthesizes current information from the various fields of cognitive science in support of a new and exciting theory of mind. Most psychologists study horizontal processes like memory and information flow; Fodor postulates a vertical and modular psychological organization underlying biologically coherent behaviors. This view of mental architecture is consistent with the historical tradition of faculty psychology while integrating a computational approach to mental processes. One of the most notable aspects of Fodor's work is that it articulates features not only of speculative cognitive architectures but also of current research in artificial intelligence. -- Publisher description.},

  volume = {20},
  abstract = {Everyone knows that attention to the details disrupts skilled performance, but little empirical evidence documents this fact. We show that attention to the hands disrupts skilled typewriting. We had skilled typists type words preceded by cues that told them to type only the letters assigned to one hand or to type all of the letters. Cuing the hands disrupted performance markedly, slowing typing and increasing the error rate (Experiment 1); these deleterious effects were observed even when no keystrokes were actually inhibited (Experiment 3). However, cuing the same letters with colors was not disruptive (Experi- ment 2). We account for the disruption with a hierarchical control model, in which an inner loop controls the hands and an outer loop controls what is typed. Typing letters using only one hand requires the outer loop to monitor the inner loop's output; the outer loop slows inner-loop cycle time to increase the likelihood of inhibiting responses with the unwanted hand. This produces the disruption.},

  abstract = {The idea that cognition is controlled hierarchically is appealing to many but is difficult to demonstrate empirically. Often, nonhierarchical theories can account for the data as well as hierarchical ones do. The purpose of this chapter is to document the case for hierarchical control in skilled typing and present it as an example of a strategy for demonstrating hierarchical control in other cognitive acts. We propose that typing is controlled by two nested feedback loops that can be distinguished in terms of the factors that affect them, that communicate through intermediate representations (words), that know little about how each other work, and rely on different kinds of feedback. We discuss hierarchical control in other skills; the relation between hierarchical control and familiar concepts like automaticity, procedural memory, and implicit knowledge; and the development of hierarchical skills. We end with speculations about the role of hierarchical control in everyday cognition and the search for a meaningful life.},

  abstract = {Two experiments evaluated skilled typists' ability to report knowledge about the layout of keys on a standard keyboard. In Experiment 1, subjects judged the relative direction of letters on the computer keyboard. One group of subjects was asked to imagine the keyboard, one group was allowed to look at the keyboard, and one group was asked to type the letter pair before judging relative direction. The imagine group had larger angular error and longer response time than both the look and touch groups. In Experiment 2, subjects placed one key relative to another. Again, the imagine group had larger angular error, larger distance error, and longer response time than the other groups. The two experiments suggest that skilled typists have poor explicit knowl- edge of key locations. The results are interpreted in terms of a model with two hierarchical parts in the system controlling typewriting.},

  shorttitle = {Concurrent {{Counting}} and {{Typing}}},
  abstract = {In previous demonstrations of differences between left- and right-handers in dual-task performance, participants' hand preference has been confounded with asymmetry of manual skill. The present study was designed to disentangle those two factors as sources of lateralized interference in the concurrent-task paradigm. Forty-eight normal adults (24 females and 24 males) counted backward by ones or by twos while typing an easy or difficult sequence of letters with either hand. When participants were grouped according to self-reported hand preference, both groups showed bilaterally symmetric slowing, relative to single-task conditions. However, when the same participants were grouped according to manual asymmetry in the baseline condition, the cognitive task interfered significantly more with the faster hand than with the slower hand. Baseline typing rate, averaged across hands, did not influence dual-task interference. Both self-reported left-hand preference and left-hand superiority in baseline typing were associated with reduced interference on the cognitive task, and the reduced interference in those groups seemed to reflect relatively loose coupling between manual and cognitive tasks. The results support and extend Caroselli et al.'s (1997) findings regarding the effect of baseline manual asymmetry on the pattern of dual-task interference. Irrespective of the participant's hand preference, the presence or absence of baseline asymmetry may be sufficient to determine whether dual-task interference is lateralized.},
